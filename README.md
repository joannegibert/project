# SEIRD Modelling of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)

## Project Description

This project implements a SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) epidemiological model to simulate HPAI dynamics. The core numerical simulation is developed in C for computational efficiency, solving the system of differential equations for nine scenarios.

The entire workflow is automated using MATLAB, which serves as a wrapper to:
1. Execute the compiled C program for various parameter sets.
2. Process the generated time-series data.
3. Compute key epidemiological metrics.
4. Generate comprehensive visualizations for comparative analysis.

### Input files

- **`data/parameters.csv`**: A CSV file defining the epidemiological parameters for **9 distinct scenarios**.
  - **Format**: Each row corresponds to one scenario.
  - **Columns**: 
    - `beta` (transmission rate)
    - `gamma` (recovery rate)
    - `mu` (mortality rate)
    - `N` (total population size)
    - `sigma` (incubation rate)
  - The C program reads these 9 rows sequentially to generate the corresponding outputs (from Scenario 1 to Scenario 9).

### Output files

Describe the output files generated by the program. (To be generated in "results/".)

### Report

Templates for .tex and .odt formats are provided in "docs/". The formatting can be changed, but the sections should remain the same. The final report should be placed in "docs/" as "report.pdf".

## Running the program

### Dependencies

Describe the operating system, programs (MATLAB/Python/C), version numbers, and external packages that need to be installed to run the program. Canonically, it should run on the SIE Linux VDI, but if you require a different configuration (e.g., more updated MATLAB version) you can state it here.

### Build

Describe how the C program should be compiled (using gcc or mex). The executable or shared object file can be placed in the "bin/" directory.

### Execute

Describe how the program should be executed. Ideally, it will be automated to one line of code in a terminal running Bash (e.g., `matlab -batch src/myscript`), with the outputs generated to "results/".
