# SEIRD Modelling of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)

## Project Description

This project implements a SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) epidemiological model to simulate HPAI dynamics. The core numerical simulation is developed in C for computational efficiency, solving the system of differential equations for nine scenarios.

The entire workflow is automated using MATLAB, which serves as a wrapper to:
1. Execute the compiled C program for various parameter sets.
2. Process the generated time-series data.
3. Compute key epidemiological metrics.
4. Generate comprehensive visualizations for comparative analysis.

### Input files

**`data/parameters.csv`**: a CSV file defining the epidemiological parameters for **9 distinct scenarios**.
  - **Format**: Each row corresponds to one scenario.
  - **Columns**: 
    - `beta` (transmission rate $\beta$)
    - `gamma` (recovery rate $\gamma$)
    - `mu` (mortality rate $\mu$)
    - `N` (total population size $N$)
    - `sigma` (incubation rate $\sigma$)
  - The C program reads these 9 rows sequentially to generate the corresponding outputs (from Scenario 1 to Scenario 9).

### Output files
All simulation results and visualizations are automatically generated in the `results/` directory:

1. **Simulation Data (CSV)**:
   - `scenario_1.csv` to `scenario_9.csv`: Time-series data generated by the C program for each of the 9 scenarios.
     - **Columns**: `time` (from 0 to 2000 days), `S` (Susceptible), `E` (Exposed), `I` (Infected), `R` (Recovered), `D` (Deceased).

2. **Summary Metrics**:
   - `summary_results.csv`: a table computed by MATLAB containing key metrics for all scenarios:
     - Peak infected.
     - Total deaths.
     - Time to epidemic decline (days until $R_{eff} < 1$).
     - Time to epidemic end (days until the end of the epidemic).

3. **Visualizations**:
   - `Figure_1.png`: 3×3 grid showing S, E, I, R, D dynamics for all 9 scenarios.
   - `Figure_2.png`: detailed full-scale trajectory for Scenario 4.
   - `Figure_3.png`: evolution of the effective reproduction number $R_{eff}(t)$ over time.
   - `Figure_4.png`: bar chart comparing epidemic timing metrics (Time to Decline and Time to End).
   - `Figure_5.png`: bar chart comparing population impact metrics (Peak infected and Total deaths).
  
### Report

Templates for .tex and .odt formats are provided in "docs/". The formatting can be changed, but the sections should remain the same. The final report should be placed in "docs/" as "report.pdf".

## Running the program

### Dependencies

This project is designed to run in a standard Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS) or Windows, specifically compatible with the **SIE Linux VDI**.

**Required Software:**
- **C Compiler**: `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) or any standard C compiler.
- **MATLAB**: Version **R2025a**.
  - Note: The code uses standard MATLAB functions and should remain compatible with older versions (e.g., R2023b+).
  - Required toolboxes: None.

**System Requirements:**
- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- No external libraries are required.

### Build

To compile the C program, open a terminal in the project directory and run:
`gcc src/seird_model.c -o bin/seird_model`

This creates the executable in the `bin/` directory.

### Execute

The entire workflow (simulation + visualization) is automated via MATLAB.
Run the MATLAB automation script from the project root: 
`matlab -batch "run('src/seird_plot.m')"`
